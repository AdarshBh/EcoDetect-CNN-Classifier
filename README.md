# EcoDetect-CNN-Classifier
# ♻️ EcoDetect – Waste Classification using ResNet50  

EcoDetect is a deep learning project that classifies **waste images** into **Biodegradable** or **Non-Biodegradable** categories.  
The model is trained on a **Kaggle waste dataset** using **ResNet50** as the convolutional backbone.
